# Frontend

This directory contains the TypeScript React code for the frontend of Dashdoc (web version).

We use [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) as a dev server and to build the code for production.

The environment variables defined in the `env/` directory are used in the respective modes. To override some variables locally, create a file `env/.env.local` where you can specify some environment variables.
