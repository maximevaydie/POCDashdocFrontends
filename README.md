### POC - Proposition for Dashdoc's frontend folder structure

Work in progress.

This Repository contains a POC suggesting a monorepo folders structure.

Key goals:
- Clear, standard and conventional architecture for a JS monorepo.
- Common extendable configuration packages.
- Shareable logic and react components (design system...).
- Shareable service consumption (typing, methods...).
- Benefits from TurboRepo flow.
- Easier new-comers onboarding.
(to complete)
